Github allows you to host your website for free, update it super quickly, and will never bug (unlike those sneaker ruby gem updates for your Jekyll page…) :-) Sure, you could make your page using Google Sites, but making your own page from scratch is much more fun!\n\nStart from Emily Zabor’s super simple guide here. Run through the complete guide first, before tweaking the design.\nLearn the basics of RMarkdown to create your own content:\n\nRMarkdown basics here\nMore RMarkdown basics here\nMaking websites using RMarkdown here\n\nThen tweak the design of your website by digging into more advanced topics using more complete guides:\n\nThis online book here\nYan Holtz’s RMarkdown tips here\nAcademic Icons (e.g. for your contact list) here\n\nNote: for more control, you may want to learn a bit about HTML for organizing content and CSS for styling."

I investigate environmental and socioeconomic dimensions such as sustainable farming practices, climate change mitigation and adaptation, food security and resilience, nutrient and fertilizer management, and market and price impacts. I use integrated modelling, scenario analysis and impact assessment to support policy design, evaluation and decision making.\nMy earlier academic experience (2006–2019) includes research and teaching at the Agricultural University of Athens, covering data collection and analysis, model development, project management, grant writing, teaching, supervision, and curriculum design.\nI am the lead developer and maintainer of IFM-CAP, an EU-wide farm-level model that simulates farmers’ production and management decisions to evaluate the impacts of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and other agricultural policies.

    "text": "Do organic farming policies need to be more target-oriented to achieve sustainability?\nRey Vicario, D., Kremmydas, D., Baldoni, E., Ciaian, P., & Tillie, P. Journal of environmental management, 394, 127342, doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.127342.\nCompares three EU organic conversion strategies (action-based, result-based, and combined) using IFM-CAP. Result-oriented policy delivers higher GHG reductions per euro by targeting high‑emitting livestock farms but is costlier and may miss the 25% area target. Action‑oriented policy is cheaper and closer to the 25% area goal but achieves lower emission reductions. Recommendation: target farms with greater emission‑reduction potential rather than only expanding converted area. Download \n\n\n\nClosing the EU protein gap – drivers, synergies and trade-offs\nHristov, J., Tassinari, G., Himics, M., Beber, C., Barbosa, A.L., Isbasoiu, A., Klinnert, A., Kremmydas, D., Tillie, P., & Fellmann, T., JRC Report, Publications Office of the European Union, ISBN , dx.doi.org/10.2760/84255\nThe report argues that EU protein policy must link plant-protein supply with food- and feed-sector demand. It evaluates four scenarios: supporting protein crops, changing feed practices, restructuring livestock, and shifting to plant-based diets. Results show that combining supply- and demand-side changes brings the largest environmental gains and reduces reliance on imported protein. An integrated strategy is needed to support farmers, strengthen resilience, and manage impacts during the transition.\n\nThe EU target for organic farming: Potential economic and environmental impacts Kremmydas, D., Beber, C., Baldoni, E., Ciaian, P., Fellmann, T., Gocht, A., Hristov, J., Pignotti, D., Rey Vicario, D., Stepanyan, D., & Tillie, P. Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy, 47(2), 602-623. doi.org/10.1002/aepp.13470\nThe EU aims to reach 25% of the total agricultural area under organic farming by 2030. Interlinking a farm-level and agro-economic market model, we assess impacts of achieving the target either at Member State or aggregated EU level. Results show that flexible budget allocation across Member States would be more cost-efficient and less detrimental to EU production. Conversely, targeting at Member State level proves more effective in generating greater aggregated and more evenly distributed environmental benefits across EU regions. The results indicate the importance of leveraging tailored approaches to optimize organic farming outcomes across the EU. Download \n\n\n\nModeling conversion to organic agriculture with an EU-wide farm model\nKremmydas, D.; Ciaian, P.; Baldoni, E.\nBio-Based and Applied Economics, 12(4), 261–304. https://doi.org/10.36253/bae-13925 The paper evaluates the EU Farm to Fork target of reaching 25% organic farmland by 2030 using a farm-level model. It compares two ways of modelling conversions to organic farming: an endogenous approach, where farmers decide based on utility differences, and an exogenous approach, based on econometric estimates of conversion likelihood. Results differ by method: farm income changes range from a 3.8% increase (endogenous) to a 1.3% decrease (exogenous). Both approaches, however, predict lower agricultural production (between 0.5% and 15%) for most crops and livestock products if the target is met.
