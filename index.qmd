I am an **Assistant Professor of Decision Making in Farm Management** at the  
**Department of Agricultural Economics and Rural Development**, Agricultural University of Athens.  

From **2019 to 2025**, I worked as an **Economic Modeller and Deputy Team Leader** at the  
**European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC), Unit D4 – Economics of the Food System** in Seville, Spain.  

My work focused on quantitative socio-economic analysis related to the Green Deal, the Farm to Fork Strategy, CAP, and EU food systems, including organic farming, sustainable farming practices, nitrogen taxation, fertilizer price impacts, GAEC adoption costs, CAP simplification, and modelling of CAP Strategic Plans.

I am the **main developer of the IFM-CAP** EU-wide farm model, have collaborated extensively with DG AGRI (including SCENAR2040 and FSDN design), and participated in the EU Horizon projects **MINDSTEP** and **TOOLS4CAP**.  
My technical work spans micro-data processing, econometrics, spatial analysis, machine learning for micro-data synthesis, and advanced policy modelling.

My earlier academic experience (2010–2019) includes research and teaching at the Agricultural University of Athens, covering data collection and analysis, model development, project management, grant writing, teaching, supervision, and curriculum design.  
I previously worked as a researcher and technical assistant (2006–2010) and as a researcher for the magazine *Olive and olive oil*.
