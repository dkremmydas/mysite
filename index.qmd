I am an **Assistant Professor of Decision Making in Farm Management** at the [Department of Agricultural Economics and Rural Development](https://aoa.aua.gr){target="_blank"} at the Agricultural University of Athens in Greece.  

From 2019 to 2025, I worked as an **Economic Modeller and Deputy Team Leader** at the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC), Unit D4 – Economics of the Food System in Seville, Spain.  

My research focuses on quantitative socio-economic analysis and modelling of food systems and agricultural policy, with applications to the Green Deal, Farm to Fork, CAP and related EU and national policies. I investigate environmental and socioeconomic dimensions such as sustainable farming practices, climate change mitigation and adaptation, food security and resilience, nutrient and fertilizer management, and market and price impacts. I use integrated modelling, scenario analysis and impact assessment to support policy design, evaluation and decision making.

My earlier academic experience (2006–2019) includes research and teaching at the Agricultural University of Athens, covering data collection and analysis, model development, project management, grant writing, teaching, supervision, and curriculum design.

I am the lead developer and maintainer of [IFM-CAP](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC127014){target="_blank"}, an EU-wide farm-level model that simulates farmers' production and management decisions to evaluate the impacts of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and other agricultural policies. Built on FADN/FSDN microdata, IFM-CAP integrates farm heterogeneity, biophysical constraints and economic behaviour to assess environmental, production and income outcomes under alternative scenarios.
